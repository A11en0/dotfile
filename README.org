** Work for
- systemd auto-login
- startx + i3-gaps + polybar 
- xterm + tmux
- dmenu
- emacs, vim
- misc.

** Installation
*** Preparation
1). Edit =/etc/apt/sources.list= file.
   : nano /etc/apt/sources.list
   You just need the following 3 lines in this file:
   : deb http://mirrors.163.com/debian testing main non-free contrib
   : deb http://mirrors.163.com/debian testing-updates main non-free contrib
   : deb http://mirrors.163.com/debian testing-proposed-updates main non-free contrib
   Use =Ctrl-o= to save, and =Ctrl-x= to quit nano.
2). Upgrade Your system:
   : apt update && apt dist-upgrade
   This step takes usually about 20 minutes if your network is not too slow.

*** Download and configuration the dotfile
Clone my dotfiles from the repo.
: git clone git@github.com:A11en0/mydot.git
Now you should see a new directory =dotfile= sitting in your =$HOME= directory with all
necessory config files in it. Still some more things to do...
1) Make sure you are in your =$HOME=.
   : cd
2) Remove some old files.
   : rm -f .bash*
3) Link the config files in directory =dotfile= to your =$HOME=.
   : ln -sf dotfile/dot.* ./
   : ln -sf dotfile/help/dot.* ./
   : ls
   You should find that there are lots of =dot.= prefixed files in your =$HOME= directory.
4) Rename these =dot.*= files.
   : rename 's/dot//' dot.*
   : ls -al
   All the =dot.*= files should be replaced by =.= prefixed files now.
# 6) Grab my Emacs packages.
   # : wget http://cs6.swfu.edu.cn/~wx672/debian-install/elpa.tgz
   # : mv elpa.tgz ~/.emacs.d/
   # : cd ~/.emacs.d
   # : tar zxf elpa.tgz
# 7) Emacs test run
   # : emacs --debug-init
   # If you see error messages, let me know (wx672ster@gmail.com).

*** Install softwares
Find the software list files in the dotfile directory: "01-important", "02-recommend", "03-chinese", etc. And install by you need.
: su
: apt install $(cat 01-important)

Alternative:
: apt install $(cat 02-recommend)
: apt install $(cat 03-chinese)
...

*** Sudo
If you don't want to be asked for password whenever using =sudo=, you can do the following:
1. Working as /root/
   : su
   input root password.
2. Create a new file in =/etc/sudoers.d/= directory.
   : nano /etc/sudoers.d/your-user-name
   *Caution:* Replace =your-user-name= with your real username.
3. Add the following line into the file you are editing:
   : your-user-name  ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL
   *Caution:* Replace =your-user-name= with your real username.

   Save and quit editing.
4. Change the mode of that file to =0440=.
   : chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/your-user-name
5. Quit root shell
   : exit
6. Now, try =sudo ls=, you shouldn't be asked for password any longer.

*** Auto login
If you don't want to input username/password every time when you start your system, you
can do like this:
: sudo cp -r ~/dotfile/etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/ /etc/systemd/system/
: sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/override.conf
There are just three lines in this file:
: [Service]
: ExecStart=
: ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --autologin username --noclear %I $TERM
*Caution:* Replace =username= with your own username.

Now, it's time to reboot your system.
: sudo reboot
